This document describes [this shinyapp](https://paurabassa.shinyapps.io/project) developed as the final assigment of the course *Developing Data Products*. 

It uses the shinny interface to visualize the data in the `HairEyeColor` dataset. 
This dataset is a 3-dimensional array resulting from cross-tabulating 592 
observations on 3 variables. 

The app displays a boxplot of the observed 
number of eye color for the data with the selected sex and hair-color.
